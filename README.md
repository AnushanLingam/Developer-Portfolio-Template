#### Requirements
* Node.js
* NPM 

#### How to use
1) Clone or download the repo and run `npm install`.

2) Navigate to `src/data/profile.js` and follow the instructions there to fill out your information

3) Run `npm run dev` from the root directory of the project then visit `http://localhost:5000/` to see your site.

#### Customisation

While this is setup to quickly generate a site from the profile.js file you fill in, you can easily customise layouts 
and colours etc. For full customistation you can visit the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) page to see what components can be 
customised.

To simply change the colours and fonts just open the theme.js file found in `src/components` and modify the properties of the theme object. You can checkout the colours and other customisations that Material-UI ships with by going [here](https://material-ui.com/customization/themes/)
